### About

My collection of mods for Diablo 2 Resurrected - Infernal Edition v3.0.91636.

The credits go to their respective authors.

The way you use D2R's mods is very similar to the way you use D2 LoD's mods of similar nature.

Move folders such as "hd", "global" and "local" to D2R's "data" folder, then make a shortcut to the game's exe with the parameters "-direct -txt" at the end of its Target field.

### Contents
